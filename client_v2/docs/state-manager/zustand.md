### [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand)
`Zustand` is a state management library for React 
applications that allows you to manage stateful 
logic in a simple and scalable way. It uses a 
minimalist approach to state management, where 
the state is stored in a single object called a 
"store". You can then define actions to modify 
the state, and use selectors to extract specific 
parts of the state that your components need.

`Zustand` is built on top of the Context API and 
uses hooks to provide a simple and intuitive API 
for managing state. It also supports middleware, 
which allows you to add additional functionality 
such as logging, caching, or network requests to 
your state management logic.

Overall, `Zustand` is a great choice for small to 
medium-sized React applications that require 
simple and scalable state management. It is 
easy to learn and use, and provides a lot of 
flexibility and power for managing your 
application state.
